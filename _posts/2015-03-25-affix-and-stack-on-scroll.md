A simple javascript to stack elements at the top of the screen when the user scrolls. It's kind of like the affix plugin
in Twitter Bootstrap, except that you don't have to supply the offset-top yourself and elements are stacked under the top
navigation bar. 

### Code and Demo

Because Codepen shows the demo in an *iframe*, the *postion:fixed* doesn't work on iOS. As a result, Twitter Bootstrap's navbar won't
stick to the top of the screen. So, if you're on an iPhone or iPad you can check it out [here in fullscreen](http://s.codepen.io/nicohaemhouts/debug/YPBLzB).
